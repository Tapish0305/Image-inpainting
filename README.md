# Image-inpainting
Image Inpainting is the art of filling in damaged or missing pixels of an image. It is the process of reconstructing missing parts of an image so that observers are unable to tell that these regions have undergone restoration. The outcomes of this project converges onto to inpaint an image to recover any damage on it. Given an image, the algorithm proceeds to represent and manipulate it to obtain a corrected image which supposedly has lesser damage. This project is a recreation of the paper Image Inpainting for Irregular Holes Using Partial Convolutions using CIFAR-10 dataset and Natural Images dataset from Kaggle.
